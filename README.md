# Chat-App_Client-Server-Model_Python_Senior-Year

This program assigned my senior year of high school during our Python unit. <br/>
The attatched Client.py and Server.py files contain the code I submitted for this program.

**Instructions:**
- Make a working chat app in which multiple clients can connect to a server by entering a username, IP address, and port into a GUI login window.
- Once a client connects to the server, they can chat back and forth to other clients via a GUI chat window, which displays the usernames of who sent which message and sends messages when clients join or leave.

**Major Take Aways:**
- Learned how to navigate Tkinter, a poorly documented Python library.
- Developed an in-depth understanding of how client-server models work.
- Learned TCP networking / socket programming in Python.
